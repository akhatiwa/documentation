# Example 2

An example containing data for two plots.
Data in the example is not real, it's arbitrary and only serves demonstration purposes.

In the first item, we illustrate the optional use of pre-generated images (typically used to
capture published plots representing the HEPData entry). Since it's for demonstration only,
we use the PHENIX logo as the image.

Note systematic and statistical errors for each data point.

# Instructions

Create a tar file containing all YAML and PNG files.
Use the "sandbox" feature of HEPData to upload
to the private testing area and observe the result of the upload.
The data can be tweaked and re-uploaded to the same sandbox if you
want to check how modified inputs affects the displayed data.
