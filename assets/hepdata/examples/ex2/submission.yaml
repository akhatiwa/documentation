comment: "Example 2. Data is not real and only serves demonstration purposes. Data for two plots included. A PNG file and a thumbmail are added to demonstrate how image embedding works on on HEPData pages. We used the PHENIX logo for demonstration purposes, in real life you will want to include real plots corresponding to each table. Such imagres are optional but are used pretty frequently."
